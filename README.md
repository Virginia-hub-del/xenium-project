## Project Structure

- `analysis.py` – Main script for loading, filtering, and integrating datasets.
- `requirements.txt` – List of required Python packages.
- **Note:** Data files are not included due to size and privacy constraints.

## Objectives

- Integrate multiple breast cancer spatial datasets
- Compare gene expression across epithelial subtypes
- Visualize differentially expressed genes using dot plots

## Installation
